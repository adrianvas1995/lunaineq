\description{
Computes the absolute inequality gap between the extreme social groups defined based on a
numeric equity stratifier. The function operates in two modes: \strong{(Mode A)} using a numerator and
denominator (\code{health_numerator} and \code{health_denominator}), which is the preferred
and most accurate method, as it relies directly on event counts;
and \strong{(Mode B)} using an aggregated health indicator (\code{health_indicator})
and population weights (\code{population_weights}), which approximates the gap based on weighted group means.
The function also provides automatic interpretations of the results in
four languages: Spanish, English, French, and Portuguese.
}
\details{
In both cases, the social stratifier is grouped into \code{n_groups} using the selected method (e.g., quantiles),
ensuring that \emph{group 1} corresponds to the most disadvantaged group and the last group to the most advantaged
(as defined by \code{higher_ineq_is_favorable}). The absolute gap is calculated as the difference in the health indicator \eqn{y}
—defined as the mean value of the indicator within each group— between the most disadvantaged and the most advantaged groups: \eqn{\mathrm{AG} = y_{\text{disadvantaged}} - y_{\text{advantaged}}}.

\subsection{A) Using numerator and denominator (preferred)}{
When \code{health_numerator} and \code{health_denominator} are provided (Mode A), the function uses actual counts to compute the inequality gap and its confidence interval.

\itemize{
\item \strong{Proportions}: The absolute gap is calculated as the difference between the proportion of events in the most disadvantaged and the most advantaged groups. Confidence intervals are computed using \code{PropCIs::diffscoreci()}, which implements score-based intervals for the difference of two independent proportions.

\item \strong{Rates}: The absolute gap is computed as the rate difference between the two extreme groups. Counts are assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, and confidence intervals are estimated using \code{ratesci::scoreci(distrib = "poi", contrast = "RD")}, which uses score-based methods for the rate difference. Final results are scaled by \code{rate_scaling_factor} (e.g., 1,000 or 100,000).

\item \emph{This mode does not rely on population weights}: the inference is based on actual event counts, making it more statistically robust.
}
}

\subsection{B) With aggregated indicator weighted by population (approximate)}{
\itemize{
\item Based on \code{health_indicator} and \code{population_weights}, weighted group means
of the health indicator are calculated.
\item \strong{Proportions}: Wald-type CI for difference in proportions, with
\code{n} approximated using \code{population_weights}.
\item \strong{Rates}: Wald-type CI for difference in “scaled” rates;
\code{rate_scaling_factor} is used to express the result per 1,000/100,000.
\item \emph{Warning}: these CIs may under- or overestimate the
variance when sample sizes are small, heterogeneity is high,
or prior aggregation has occurred; prefer mode A when feasible.

}
\note{
Mode B was developed as an alternative for situations where only aggregated
health indicators (e.g., proportions or rates) are available, and the disaggregated
data (numerator and denominator) is not accessible. Although Mode A is more precise,
Mode B still allows for valid inequality comparisons when only summary data is available.
